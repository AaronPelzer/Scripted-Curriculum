#Unit 8 - Arrays & Loops

##Synopsis
This lesson introduces arrays and loops to our students. Students will learn how to initialize, store, and read from arrays. They will also learn how to access and manipulate individual elements of the array. Students will also learn the basics of ``while`` and ``for`` loops. They will start with ``while`` loops and learn what an index is and the broader concept of iteration. They will then be introduced to the upgraded ``for`` loop. Finally, they will connect their knowledge of arrays to loops.
