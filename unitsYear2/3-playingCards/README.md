#Project 3 - Playing Cards
![Image](http://)

##Scope
This lesson is to re-establish the concepts of manipulating arrays through native functions and loops. The contents will focus on drawing cards from a deck and viewing the cards visually.

#Before Class
Best to be familiar with the code prior to class. There are primarily 3 objects that will be handled in this lesson. Deck, hand, discard all have the same properties. Main emphasis will be on the hand object. Minor details is the deck contains 52 cards in an array. The deck handles the cards drawn from the deck. Students can input the amount of cards to draw from the deck. Discard is storage for the pervious hand so that hand can store new cards.

~~Also be sure to include a stater and solution sample code.~~

~~A note to curriculum writers: Do not worry about this section, Tom will complete this at a later date.~~  


#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class they are to load up the template in their IDE and make a local copy. Have them look through the code breifly so they can start getting an idea of what this project will entail. 

##Opening


##Lecture
Before students begin work on this project they must be introduced to the following concepts. The lecturer may decide the best way to deliver these topics.

##Project Creation Time
~~A note to curriculum writers: How will the room look while the project is being completed? Are students in groups? Is there storyboarding? How are the teachers assisting? etc..~~

##Closing
~~A note to curriculum writers: How should the day be wrapped up? Was the day modeled like a competition, or could this end with a series of questions and a conversation with the room?~~

##Check for Understanding
~~A note to curriculum writers: How will the teacher know that all the students were successful. How do we know they learned the skills listed above?~~

##How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

##Homework
