#Project 3 - Playing Cards
![Image](http://)

##Scope
This lesson is to re-establish the concepts of manipulating arrays through native functions and loops. The contents will focus on drawing cards from a deck and viewing the cards visually.

#Before Class
Best to be familiar with the code prior to class. 
There are primarily 3 objects that will be handled in this lesson. Deck, hand, discard all have the same properties. Main emphasis will be on the hand object which will be the focus. Minor details is the deck contains 52 cards in an array. The hand handles the cards drawn from the deck. Students can input the amount of cards to draw from the deck. Discard is storage for the pervious hand so that hand can store new cards.

~~Also be sure to include a stater and solution sample code.~~

##Vocabulary

##Industry Skills
This project improves the student's industry skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)


Arrays
Loops within Loops
Event
Functions

**Technical Vocabulary:**  
While completing this project the student will..

**Paired Programming:**   
While completing this project the student will pick a teammate so they can build this project together. One can code while the other works out the logic and googles. The roles can always shift.

**Code Review:**   
While completing this project the student will debug any problems occurs. If a problem is present students will need to understand why it happened and how it was resolved.

**Search Engine Skills:**  
While completing this project the student will need to google how to finish particular logic problems. Loops within loop to handle card generation. As well how to use Math.Random functions and other problems that persist.

**Command Line:**  
While completing this project the student will..

**Debugging**  
While completing this project the student will use the browser debugging to monitor how variables are passed from functions and loops in arrays and also create small tests within to see what values are being produced.


##Web Programming Skills
This project improves the student's web programming skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)


**Templating:**   
While completing this project the student will create functions and or complete logic within templated functions.


##Year One Review
This project will improve upon the following skills from the [Year 1 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AobNdyExPHV5dGRWMVI0QVpnSWYtczZZT2ZyV01kcmc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)  
~~A note to curriculum writers: Do not worry about this section, Tom will complete this at a later date.~~  


#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class they are to load up the template in their IDE and make a local copy. Have them look through the code breifly so they can start getting an idea of what this project will entail.


##Opening
This is an introdcution into data mainipulation. Arrays are a requirement of storing and using data in the programming fields. This is not just specific to Javascript but to all languages. This will help you get familiar with the concepts of arrays and Data Structures.


##Lecture
Before students begin work on this project they must be introduced to the following concepts. The lecturer may decide the best way to deliver these topics. *
Light review of variables, functions, parameters and loops.
- Special emphasis on loops -


##Project Creation Time
Students are in teams of two the complete the project. They should be commincating between eachother on how to solve logic problems. Teachers should be circlingthe room and observe if any students are having difficulty or doesn't understand the problem at hand. Teacher will need a visual on an inner / outter loop in order to handle card generation.


##Closing
End with a series of questions and answers which should be asnwered by students. If it's not understandable teacher can come up with their own explanation.

##Check for Understanding
While class is progressing, teachers can randomly ask students of whats going on in their code and their thought process.


##How to Submit
Students shoud provide a url to their webpage if htye are using JSBin or share the page in Cloud9.

##Homework
That is the teachers discreation based on class progress.
