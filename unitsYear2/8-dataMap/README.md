#Project 8 - NYC Data Map

![image](http://i.imgur.com/BGvcCjt.png)

##Scope
Students will produce a heatmap showing NYC 311 service request data. The objective of this project is to expose students to the Google maps API and to a "big data" dataset. Students will gain practice with using an API to retrieve data. They will learn how to draw gradients on a Google map.

#Before Class
Introduce the concept of "big data". Show a big excel spreadsheet of data. Segue into data visualization. Draw an analogy to charts and graphs. Explain what a heatmap is and why they are used. Show an example of a heatmap.

TODO: include starter and solution code

##Vocabulary

* Big data
* Data visualization
* Heatmap
