#Project 1 - Scavenger Hunt
![Image](http://i.imgur.com/N7dzgjo.png)
##Synopsis
This main goal of this project to re-aclimate the students to the skills learned in year 1. The structure of the project is to have many short (<10 lines) programs that all have a point value determined by difficulty. There are many programs to choose from but the length of this project should be made by the teacher's discression. **The project should end when the teacher feels that all students in the class are ready to move on to project 2.** Before students are given the scavenger hunt clue worksheet they should be told the following:

 * Programs build on each other, so it is in your best interest to complete them sequentially.
  * In order to receive credit at the end of the hunt all programs must be saved (This is so the students have a library of programs to reference back to in the future.)   
 * Even though programs build on each other it is important to complete each program in its own file (there are few expections, teachers should use their best judgement). 
 * Collaboration is encouraged.. copying is not!
 * Before moving onto a new program the student must have a program checked and tallied by a teacher. 
* Prizes will be awarded to the top point earners.

#Before Class
*The teacher should acclimate themselves with the programs in the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md). This will help prepare the teacher for any questions that may arise.
*Have a system of checking off every program a student completes. It is important to keep track of which program each student has completed. This way they cannot submit a program twice. 
* Set up a scoreboard, this can either be digital or written.
*Printing a copy of the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md) for each student is recommended.

##Standards


#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class they are asked to set up a github account. If they already have a github account, ask them to login. Explain to the students how the use of version control will help them keep track of their projects. If students are using JSbin to complete today's assignments then they can easily upload to their github.  

##Opening
Explain to the students that today's project is a scavenger hunt. The "clues" are short programs that will refresh their memory  

##Lecture
Before students begin work on this project they must be introduced to the following concepts. The lecturer may decide the best way to deliver these topics.

##Project Creation
~~A note to curriculum writers: How will the room look while the project is being completed? Are students in groups? Is there storyboarding? How are the teachers assisting? etc..~~

##Closing
~~A note to curriculum writers: How should the day be wrapped up? Was the day modeled like a competition, or could this end with a series of questions and a conversation with the room?~~

##Check for Understanding
~~A note to curriculum writers: How will the teacher know that all the students were successful. How do we know they learned the skills listed above?~~

##Homework
~~A note to curriculum writers: Will you be giving any homework?~~
