##Synopsis
This main goal of this project to re-aclimate the students to the skills learned in year 1. The structure of the project is to have many short (<10 lines) programs that all have a point value determined by difficulty. There are many programs to choose from but the length of this project should be made by the teacher's discression. **The project should end when the teacher feels that all students in the class are ready to move on to project 2.** Before students are given the scavenger hunt clue worksheet they should be told the following:

 * Programs build on each other, so it is in your best interest to complete them sequentially.
 * Even though programs build on each other it is important to complete each program in its own file. 
 * Collaboration is encouraged.. copying is not!
 * In order to receive credit at the end of the hunt all programs must be saved (This is so the students have a library of programs to reference back to in the future.)   
* Prizes will be awarded to the top point earners.
