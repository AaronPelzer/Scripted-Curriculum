#Unit 4 - JavaScript

##Synopsis
This unit begins with an activity to demonstrate the difference between how a human and a program think. The first portion is completed without the use of a computer. After this, the students begin work on Scratch 2.0. Scratch is a block based programming language that allows for visual representation of a computer program without using any syntax. Through three quick activities in Scratch the students will obtain a base knowledge in creating Algorithms, Boolean Logic and Variables. 
##Lessons

1. [Variables](lessons/1-variable)
2. [Functions](lessons/2-function)
3. [Pseudo-code & comments](lessons/3-pseudocode)
4. [Project](lessons/4-project)

##Standards

###CPP.L2-05 I - Variables
1. Student	can	create,	name,	and	assign	values	to	variables.
2. Student	understands	and	can	explain	variable	creation,	reassignment,	and	scope.

###CPP.L2-05 I - Math operators
1.	Student	can	employ	math	functions	such	as	``pow``,	``rand``,	``ceiling``,	and	``floor``	to	manipulate	numbers.
2.	Student	understands	JavaScript	operator	precedence	and	can	use	it	to	predict	the	effect	of	an	expression.	
3.	Student	can	recognize	augmented	assignment	operators	(``i+=1``)	and	can	decompose	them	to	simpler	syntax.	
4.	Student	can	generate	random	numbers	and	control	their	range	to	produce	complex	behavior	in	interactive	pages.	
5.	Student	can	handle	``null``,	``NaN``	or	``undefined``	inputs	to	calculations	when	solving	programming	problems.

###CL.L3B-03, CL.L2-04, CL.L3B-01
1.	Student	can	plan	a	project	with	teammates	(using	wire	frames,	specifications	/ requirements,	and	pseudocode).
2.	Student	can	maintain	a	design	by	contract	relationship	with	other	team	members;	student	can	write	clear	code;	student	can	explain	code	by	including	clarifying	comments	in	their	code
