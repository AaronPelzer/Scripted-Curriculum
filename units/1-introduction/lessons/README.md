### Opening

Today we will learn about variables in JavaScript. This is important because we can use variables to store things that we can later on look up. It connects to what we've previously learned because we will be able to, eventually, write JavaScript code that interacts with the HTML & CSS we have written before.

What is a programming language? Give me some examples. Remind me what a browser is. JavaScript is also a programming language and we can run it in our browser.

What is a box? Why do we put things in a box? Can we take things out of the box once we've put stuff in it?
