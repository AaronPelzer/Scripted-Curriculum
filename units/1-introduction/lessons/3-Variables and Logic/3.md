# Lesson 3 - Variables and Logic

![image](http://i.imgur.com/1Bb2Q1b.png)

## Before class
---
###Teacher Preperation
* A further understanding of Scratch. Teacher should be familiar with sensing, control and data blocks.
* The teacher should create a two variable MadLibs program with a logic condition before entering the classroom.

### Daily Objective

* Students will be able to create and implement a variable in a Scratch program.  * Student will be able to implement Boolean logic using an if/else block in a Scratch program. 

### Key points

* A variable, like the variables you use in Math class is a placeholder for a changing value.
* Variables are like boxes; they store something.
* Variables have a name and a value.
* If/Else statements let us set a condition and execute different code based on whether the condition is met.

### Assessment

1. Written Do-Now task (Printed MadLibs activity)


### Vocabulary

* Variable
* Logic
* Boolean

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Hand students a printed copy of a MadLibs activity OR students may complete online version (links provided in reference section.)

## Opening

“Please complete the MadLibs activity as a refresher to the parts of speech.” Allow 3-4 minutes to complete. Once complete have some students share their MadLibs game. Then have a class conversation revolving around variables in a game of MadLibs. Main focus of conversation should be:

* A variable is a container that stores a value (like noun) and inputs it into the story in a predetermined place decided by the creator.
## Switching Gears: Why are we here?
Ask students if they have ever taken a computer science course. Do they think it is an important skill that they wish they could have more exposure to?  * Play video “What Most Schools Don’t Teach” (see references)  * Wrap up video with a short discussion. Reflect on their thoughts.
## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)
**Ask overarching question:** Who is smarter, a human or a computer?  
Students should then be broken up into groups of 3-4 to form their own opinions for 2-3 minutes.   
Teacher should regroup whole class after groups have had a chance to speak. “So what does everyone think? Who is smarter?” At this time a small debate should stir up in the class. Teacher should direct conversation to end with a claim that resembles the idea of “Computers are better at some stuff, but they can’t think for themselves.”
## Guided Practice (“We Do”)
Teacher asks a student (preferably a student in the front row) to get up and take a piece of paper off the back wall and place it on a desk. **The paper should be placed in the back of the room before class.
“Notice how I gave him/her about 2-3 directions to complete this task.” “Now let’s try something different. **I am a robot.** Give me directions to do the same with the other piece of paper on the back wall.” Students will now give directions one at a time in order of where they are sitting. The teacher will follow the directions exactly as they are stated.For example: If the direction is stated as “Turn right” the teacher should spin in place clockwise until the next student tells them to “Stop.”
## Independent practice ("You do")
Students then break up into groups of two’s, one human and one robot. The human in the group will provide directions to the robot, WITHOUT LOOKING, to draw a smiley face. The robot will then draw as it is instructed to. 

## Closing/ Homework

Today for homework you are going to complete a similar process that will be acted out in class tomorrow. Write directions, for a robot, to fold a paper airplane.

## After Class

* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
