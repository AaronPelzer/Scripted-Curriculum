## Before class

### Objective

Students will be able to create, initialize, access, and manipulate arrays.

### Key points

* Lists in real life are arrays in the programming world.
* Arrays are made up of elements. These are like buckets that store something.
* Each element in an array has an index. We access elements by using these indicies.
* Arrays have a size.

### Assessment

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the exit-ticket quiz.

### Vocabulary

* Element
* Index
* Length
* Access
* Datastructure

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance.
2. TODO: some small quiz that tests students on previous lesson.

### Opening

Today we will learn about arrays. This is important because arrays are a tool that programmers can use to store and change a large set of data. It connects to what we've previously learned because we will be able to access and manipulate variables that are stored in an array.

Someone give me an example of a list in real life. A grocery list contains items that I need to buy when I go shopping. A parking lot contains a list of cars that are parked. Have we seen lists before? A string is actually a list too! It's a list of characters strung together.

### Introduction of new material ("I do")

####Create and initialize an array: 

```
var fruits=["banana", "watermelon", "apple"];
```

####Access and print the first element of our array: 

```
teams[0]
```

prints out `banana`. Here, `0` is the index. Wait. If we're accessing the first element of an array, why is our index `1` and not `0`? This is because computers start counting at 0, not 1. 

```
teams[2]Here, `0` is the index. Wait. If we're accessing the first element of an array, why is our index `1` and not `0`? This is because computers start counting at 0, not 1. 
```

prints out `apple`

####Change an element of an array:
