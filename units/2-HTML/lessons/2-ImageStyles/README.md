### Key points

* A relative URL is saved locally within your library.
* An absolute URL is a link to something saved online.

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Starter question to students on the board: How is a website created?



## Opening

“Does anyone want to answer the starter question?” Students should answer the question and eventually arrive at the fact that HTML is a language used to create webpages. ## Introduction of new material: Scratch (“I Do”)
“So we all know HTML is used to write a webpage, but has anyone ever seen HTML code?” The teacher should now open a website students are familiar with on the screen and view the page source. Once here change some of the text on the webpage. Ask students “How did I know where to look in the HTML.”
## Guided Practice (“We Do”)
“Okay everyone open your computers and follow along with me.” Once again on the board open another website. This time a very plain page with little to no CSS (recommendation: use the first site made at Cern.. see references.) All together, find a specific piece of text and manipulate it. ## Independent practice ("You do")
“Now I want everyone to take the next 3 minutes to change as many things on this webpage as possible.”Teacher should now circulate and assist any student who does not understand how to manipulate HTML text. After the 3 minutes are complete encourage students to share what they changed on the site.## Introduction of new material #2 (“I Do”)
Before starting this section ask students to close their laptops and take notes. The teacher will give a 3-4 minute lecture on tags, tag stucture and FILO (First In Last Out). The teacher may use the Google Presentation provide in the references.
## Guided Practice #2(“We Do”)
“Okay everyone open your computers and follow along with me.” Once again on the board open another website. This time a very plain page with little to no CSS (recommendation: use the first site made at Cern.. see references.) All together, find a specific piece of text and manipulate it. ## Independent practice #2("You do")

## Closing/ Homework
Wrap up the day with a quick recap on everything that was covered. Ask the students to share their webpages with you for review.

* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.#2
