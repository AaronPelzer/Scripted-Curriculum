#Lesson 3 - Pseudo-code & comments

![image](http://i.imgur.com/p3Lk9UX.jpg)

## Before class

### Objective

Students will able to transform pseudo-code into actual JavaScript code. They will be able to appropriately comment their code.

### Key points

* When we're given a programming task, we first think about it in our heads and with paper and pencil. Only when this is complete can we move to the keyboard.
* Pseudo-code is like an outline for an essay; it communicates the gist of what you're going to write without specifying all the details.
* Comments are a way for programmers to document their code so that others can understand it.

### Assessment

1. Write do-now based off of [assessments from previous lesson](../../4-javascript/lessons/2-function/assessments/).
2. Write exit-ticket based off [assessments from current lesson](assessments/).

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the exit-ticket quiz.

### Vocabulary

* Pseudo-code
* Design
* Algorithm
* Code comments

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Do-now quiz

### Opening

Today we will learn about how to approach a programming problem. We will also learn how to document our code so that others can understand it. The former is important because programming problems can be very complex. Having a certain approach can help break down the complexity. The latter is important because you will eventually be programming alongside others. They will need to be able to understand your code and vice versa.

Why should we think about something before we actually do it? When do we practice this procedure? How does it help in each case?

What's an architect? What do they do? What document do they use to capture their design? Why do they make this document?

### Introduction of new material ("I do")

####Pseudo-code

When you're given a programming task, do not go to the keyboard. In fact, take a step away from the computer. Sit down at a desk and think about the task in your head. Here are some questions you should ask yourself:

1. fsdfdf

### Guided practice ("We do")

I want to write a function that converts meters to feet.

1. Let's think out loud before we start typing. What are the inputs and outputs to the function?
2. What's the formula to convert a meter to a foot?
3. What's an appropriate name for our function?
4. We've completed the prep work. Let's write the function together.

### Independent practice ("You do")

Write a function that simulates the rolling of a 9 sided die.

1. Think out loud before you start typing. What are the inputs and outputs to the function?
2. What's the formula to get a random number between 1 and 9?
3. What's an appropriate name for your function?
4. You've completed the prep work. Write the function in JavaScript. Call it a couple times to ensure it works correctly.

#### Exit ticket

Give exit-ticket quiz.

### Closing

Today you learned about how to call and create functions in JavaScript. This is important because functions let us package code that we can reuse over and over again. Others have written functions that we can use in our programs. We can also create functions to reuse in our own programs. Next, we will learn about pseudo-code and code commenting.

#### Homework

[Link to homework](homework/)

Remind students when homework is due and how it will be collected.

## After class

* Grade do-now & exit-ticket. Record in class spreadsheet.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
