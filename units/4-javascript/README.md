#Unit 4 - JavaScript

##Synopsis
This lesson starts with an introduction to variables. Students will learn how to create and edit variables. Next they will learn about functions and the elements that go into creating and calling one. They will also be exposed to functions helpful for debugging. Finally, they will learn what pseudo-code is and receive light practice with transforming it to actual JavaScript.
