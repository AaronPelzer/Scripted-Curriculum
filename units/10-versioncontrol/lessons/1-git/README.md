## Before class

### Objective

Students will understand the basics of version control. They will be able to setup an account on Github and perform the clone, push, pull, and merge operations.

### Key points

* Version control software helps programmers collaborate on code together.
* Version control software tracks all changes to your code. This enables you to revert back to an older version of the code.

### Assessment

1. Write do-now based off of [assessments from previous lesson](../../../9-jquery/lessons/1-jquery/assessments/).
2. Write exit-ticket based off [assessments from current lesson](assessments/).

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the exit-ticket quiz.

### Vocabulary

* Version control
* Git
* Github
* Repository
* Clone
* Push
* Pull
* Merge
* Stage
* Commit

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Do-now quiz

### Opening

Today we will learn about version control. This is important because version control enables us to work with others on code in an organized way.

Raise your hand if you've written an essay for English class. Walk me through the steps that happen before you submit your essay. You start with a first draft. You might get feedback from a classmate or teacher and start working on the next draft. You might realize that the next draft isn't going well and revert, or go back, to an older draft. Once you're done, you submit the final draft. To pull up a history of your work, you might find all your drafts and track the progress you made over time. 

**Version control** (also called source control) lets you save drafts of your code. This way, you and others around you can track your code. Suppose your latest draft of the code introduced a bug. With source control, you can revert the code to an older version (or draft) to eliminate the bug and then understand what caused it. 

Version control also lets groups of people collaborate on code together. Suppose you are working with a partner on the same HTML file. You are responsible for the ```<head>...</head>``` section and your partner is responsible for the ```<body>...</body>``` section. Once the both of you are done, you will need to combine each of your files together. This would involve pasting your code into your partner's code and making sure you don't accidentally break your partner's file. This doesn't seem like too much work until you start working on hundreds of files together. Using version control software, you could merge, or combine,  your work and your partner's work automatically.

### Introduction of new material ("I do")

#### Git

**Git** is an example of a version control software. It it the most widely used version control tool and supports performing the actions discussed above. For more information on Git, see the references section.

We will use Git in the command line.

#### Github

**Github** is a service that lets programmers use Git to store their work on cloud based servers. 

In the following exercise, we are going to create our own repository, copy other work into it, and then modify our copy. All commands must be performed in a command line terminal (*Window -> New Terminal* in Cloud9).

##### Sign up

If you haven't already, create an account on Github here: https://github.com/

##### Create repository

A **repository** (or repo) is a place where we store our code.

Click [here](https://github.com/new) to create one. For repository name, enter "unit-10-walkthrough". Leave everything else blank and click on the green "Create Repository" button. Do not follow the instructions on the next page.

At this point, you have an empty repository on Github.

##### Clone repository

Next, we **clone** (or copy) an existing repository onto our machine. To do this, run:

```

```


### Independent practice ("You do")



#### Exit ticket

Give exit-ticket quiz.

### Closing

Today you learned about jQuery. This is important because jQuery enables us to dynamically interact with our HTML and CSS. Next, we will do a jQuery project.

#### Homework

[Link to homework](homework/)

Remind students when homework is due and how it will be collected.

## After class

* Grade do-now & exit-ticket. Record in class spreadsheet.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
